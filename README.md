none. Just this github repo. Heroku was being a pain and we ended up scrapping the idea of hosting it online.

## What is College Recipes?
College recipes is a simple project that allows students to search through a database of recipes based on what they have in their fridge.
Ideally we would have used an API but the one we were using, BigOven API, became a paid API. Unfornately we are all broke college students and couldn't afford the switch so we used a static database instead.
Technology Used:

   - Django
   - Python 3
   - CSS
   - HTML
   - JavaScript
   - jQuery
   - Deployment process

### Progress
This project is pretty good for the time we had in our opinion, but it could be a lot better. Next steps would be dynamic database and being able to update everything. Other things would include Admin functionality and also being able to make users.
